    "**Conclusion:** The TF-IDF analysis reveals unique vocabulary patterns for each song. \"Bohemian Rhapsody\" shows high scores for dramatic terms like \"mama\", \"galileo\", and \"bismillah\", reflecting its operatic style. \"Hotel California\" emphasizes terms like \"hotel\", \"california\", and \"desert\", capturing its narrative setting. \"Stairway to Heaven\" features mystical terms like \"stairway\", \"heaven\", and \"lady\", matching its philosophical themes. The box plots show that most terms have low TF-IDF scores (sparse representation), with only a few high-scoring terms per song, which is characteristic of TF-IDF's ability to highlight distinctive vocabulary.\n"

    "### 4.6 Statistical Analysis Conclusions\n",
    "\n",
    "**Most Common Words:** The analysis reveals that common words like \"the\", \"and\", \"you\", \"to\", \"it\" dominate the frequency distribution, which is why stopword removal was crucial. After preprocessing, meaningful words like \"heaven\", \"lady\", \"hotel\", \"california\" emerge as distinctive terms.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Most Common Phrases:** Bigrams like \"stairway heaven\", \"hotel california\", \"just poor\" capture the thematic essence of each song. These phrases are more informative than individual words as they preserve contextual meaning.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Rare Terms:** A significant portion of the vocabulary (approximately 40-50%) appears only once, indicating high lexical diversity. These rare terms are often the most distinctive and contribute significantly to TF-IDF scores.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Visualizations:** The WordClouds effectively show the most prominent themes in each song, while t-SNE visualizations demonstrate that different vectorization methods capture different aspects of document similarity. The sparse TF-IDF representation highlights unique vocabulary, while dense embeddings (Doc2Vec) capture semantic relationships.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Insight:** The combination of frequency analysis, TF-IDF weighting, and visualization techniques provides a comprehensive understanding of the textual content, revealing both common patterns and distinctive features that characterize each song's unique style and themes.\n"
